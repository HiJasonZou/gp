## Course Description

Recent advances in 3D digital geometry processing have created a plenitude of novel concepts for the mathematical representation and interactive manipulation of geometric models. This course covers some of the latest developments in geometric modeling and digital geometry processing. Topics include surface modeling based on polygonal meshes, surface reconstruction, mesh improvement, mesh parametrization, discrete differential geometry, interactive shape editing, skinning animation, architectural and structure-aware geometric modeling, shape modeling with an eye on 3D printing. The students will learn how to design, program and analyze algorithms and systems for interactive 3D shape modeling and digital geometry processing.

Students will implement advanced geometry processing algorithms using C++ and libigl

By the end of the course, the students will be able to design, program and analyze algorithms and systems for interactive 3D shape modeling and digital geometry processing.
